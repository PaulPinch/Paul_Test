I totally agree!

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Create local repository (rep).
3. Mate your local and remote reps. GitHub will guide you through this.
4. Send (push) your local rep into the remote rep (you might need authorization from remote rep).
5. Make changes from another location.
6. Pull all your changes from remote rep.
